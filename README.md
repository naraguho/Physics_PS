Every codes made by my hand. Definitely, I can refer to others code in some part, but I will do my best not to duplicate their ones. Rather, even though it might be tough, I'll write it with my hands.


Main language will be Python because of its convenience. If there are some issue in time complexity, I will upload the code with C++ version.
